# CPSC 335 Fall 2023 Project 2
## Abstract
In this project, you will design, implement and analyze an exhaustive search algorithm, dynamic programming algorithm for solving the same problem.
## The Stock Purchase Maximization Problem
The problem seeks to maximize the number of stocks an investor may purchase, given a limited amount of available financial resources. The future values of these stocks are not considered at the time of purchase.

This problem can be mathematically represented as:

`input:` a set of items (<i>s<sub>i</sub></i>, ùë£ùëñ) each having a number of stocks si and value. M is the total available investment sum. 

`output:` maximum number of stocks, such that the total value of those stocks is at most M.

## Instructions
1. Have Python 3.11.5 installed.
2. Run `py .\main.py` (or `python .\main.py` depending on how PATH is setup) in terminal.
